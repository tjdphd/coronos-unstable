# c-shell script: ffts_idl.s - Timothy J. Dennis 18 October 2013                   #
#                             tdennis@gi.alaska.edu                                #
#                                                                                  #
# Developed for use with the family of Heliospheric Physics codes originating      #
# with the work of C.S. Ng and including 'rmct_np' and 'fourfields.'               #
#                                                                                  #
# Description: This script is designed to be executed from within a pbs script     #
#              though it can be run from the command line if the user knows        #
#              which arguments to pass to it, and their proper ordering.           #
#              This is, however, not recommended for jobs requiring large          #
#              numbers of plots - particularly when the data is of high            #
#              resolution.                                                         #
#                                                                                  #
#              It's function is to prepare a compute node's environment for        #
#              submission of  the batch script 'ffts_batch' to an instantiation    #
#              of idl on a compute node and allows for the generation of large     #
#              numbers of time-series plots based on high-resolution data to be    #
#              produced 'automatedly' so as to avoid the need to stress the        #
#              resources of a login node, or the patience of the code-jockey       #
#              (that would me or you) who needs said time-series plots to move his #
#              research forward.                                                   #
#                                                                                  #
#              Note: though currently designed specifically for use with           #
#                    IDL plotting scripts, it can and should be                    #
#                    generalized to work with other scripts needed by the          #
#                    family of Heliospheric codes for which it was developed,      #
#                    but these things take time...                                 #
#                                                                                  #

#                                                                                  #
#              ./ffts_idl.s       Will prompt for descriptive label and field      #
#              ./ffts_idl.s ts    Will promt for field to plot                     #
#              ./ffts_idl.s ts 2  Plots field 2 for run labeled 'ts'               #

#              Note: the argument values given here must be consistent with        #
#                    similar arguments chosen in the scripts used when             #
